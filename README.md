Here, I have created Adventure webpage using React.

In the project directory, you can run:

npm start
Runs the app in the development mode.
Open http://localhost:5173/ to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.
You may also see any lint errors in the console.


# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
